# StimJimGUI
GUI for the [StimJim](https://bitbucket.org/natecermak/stimjim) Open Source electrophysiology stimulator

The GUI offers two modes:

## Simple Mode
![Screenshot 2024-02-06 230855](https://github.com/MarinManuel/StimJimGUI/assets/65401298/632121ee-0278-4650-b66f-8415ec79f997)

In "Simple Mode", a rising pulse on TRIG0 triggers the output of a train of stimuli on OUT0, while a rising pulse on 
TRIG1 triggers OUT1. You can adjust the number and frequency of the output, as well as its intensity and duration of the 
pulses.

### Bipolar mode
Checking the "bipolar checkbox" creates a bipolar pulse such as each stimulus is immediately followed by a 
stimulus of opposite amplitude. Both pulses have equal duration and their combined duration is equal to the pulse
duration shown in the corresponding box.

### Threshold
Amplitudes can be expressed in V or A (depending on the chosen output mode), or can be expressed relative to a "threshold"
value. When the threshold amplitude as been measured, click on the `threshold` button, the value of the threshold amplitude
now appear next to the button, and the pulse amplitude is expressed as a multiple of the threshold value (e.g. If the 
threshold were 200mV, 1.5 xT would correspond to a pulse 300 mV in amplitude)

## "Full Mode"

In "Full Mode", all the settings can be freely adjusted as described in the [StimJim Documentation](https://bitbucket.org/natecermak/stimjim/src/master/)

<summary><strong>2. Clone the Repository</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarinManuel/StimJimGUI.git
cd StimJimGUI
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment</strong></summary>

### Windows:

```bash
python -m venv StimJimGUI
.\StimJimGUI\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv StimJimGUI
source StimJimGUI/bin/activate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Install Dependencies</strong></summary>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Problems

- **`pip` not recognized**: Make sure Python and pip are added to your PATH.
- **Linux/macOS permissions**: Try adding `sudo` if needed.
- **Alternative (conda environment)**: Supported if you prefer.

---

## Running
2. Activate the environment
3. Launch the GUI: `python StimJimGUI.py`
The software attempts to detect the serial port automatically, but you can also specify the port to use using the 
`--port` command line argument

Other command line arguments:
```txt
usage: StimJimGUI [-h] [-p PORT] [-l LOG] [-v]

This software provides a graphical user interface for controlling a StimJim, an open source electrophysiology stimulator for physiology and behavior

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port PORT  the serial port used to communicate with the StimJim. If not provided, then the software will try to find the port automatically, and/or offer a choice of possible ports
  -l LOG, --log LOG     save the log file to file FILENAME
  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity of output (can be repeated to increase verbosity further)
```
